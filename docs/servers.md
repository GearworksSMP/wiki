# Servers

The following is a list of servers available on Gearworks. Each server acts as a separate Fabric instance with settings that may differ between instances. Here we attempt to document most of those differences.

## Lobby

This is where everyone lands when they first visit the server. Initial implementations of the player inventory sync requires players to visit the lobby when switching survival servers. This is to help prevent race conditions where a large inventory is saved on the server the player is leaving after an old inventory has loaded on the new server already.

## Northeast
Generally the most popular server. Home to the Gearworks mall and more.

## Northwest
One of the least populated servers. The first server to house the Anomaly Investigators group.

## Southeast
Home to Uberswe and the second most popular server.

## Southwest
One of the least populated servers. This server featured the Christmas event for 2024.

## Mining
This server resets with a new world to explore every 4 days. Members are encouraged to use this server for mining and gathering resources that may be destructive otherwise.

## Creative
The creative server allows anyone to build and plan in creative mode. Players need to claim an area via FTBChunks in order to build.

## Central
This is Uberswe's personal server where he prepares builds for videos and more. Players can visit in adventure mode and use pressure plates to teleport to points of interest.

## Minigames
The minigames server features many minigames that have been featured on live streams and more. Players have also made maps for minigames like the murder mystery game.
